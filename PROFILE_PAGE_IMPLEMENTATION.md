I've successfully created a **"NĂNG LỰC" (Capabilities) section** in the ProfilePage that matches your screenshot design, featuring:

### 🎯 Key Features:
- **Large "NĂNG LỰC" title** - Bold, modern typography
- **Company branding**: "PG DESIGN" with "THIẾT KẾ & THI CÔNG TRỌN GÓI"
- **Professional description** about process optimization
- **5 key capabilities** with bullet points highlighting:
  - Complete design-to-construction management
  - 25% faster construction time
  - 10-20% cost savings
  - Modern, professional design
  - Young, passionate team

### 🖼️ Visual Elements:
- **Image gallery** with architectural renderings
- **Benefits section** at the bottom
- **Professional styling** with green color scheme
- **Fully responsive** design for all devices

## 📁 Files Created/Modified:

### New Files:
1. **`src/pages/profilePage/CapabilitiesSection.tsx`** - Main capabilities component
2. **`PROFILE_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This documentation

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/pages/profilePage/profilePage.tsx`** - Added CapabilitiesSection
2. **`src/pages/profilePage/profilePage.css`** - Added comprehensive styling

## 🌐 How to Access:

The ProfilePage with the capabilities section is now **your homepage**! 

**URL**: When you visit your website root (`/`), users will see:
1. Navigation bar
2. **Capabilities section** (your new implementation)
3. Footer
4. Floating action button

## 🎨 Design Features:

### Typography:
- **Barlow font family** for headings
- **Large, bold titles** (4.5rem for main title)
- **Hierarchical text sizing** for clear information flow

### Colors:
- **Primary green**: `#557256` (company branding)
- **Dark green**: `#2d4a35` (main text)
- **Light green gradients** for accents
- **Professional color palette** throughout

### Layout:
- **Two-column layout** on desktop (text + images)
- **Single column** on mobile for better readability
- **Grid-based image gallery** with main + side images
- **Generous spacing** for clean, professional look

## 📱 Responsive Design:

### Desktop (1024px+):
- Two-column layout with capabilities list and images side-by-side
- Large typography and full image gallery

### Tablet (768px-1024px):
- Single column layout
- Adjusted font sizes
- Maintained image quality

### Mobile (< 768px):
- Centered headers
- Stacked image gallery
- Optimized touch targets
- Smaller but readable text

## 🔧 Technical Implementation:

### Component Structure:
```
ProfilePage
└── CapabilitiesSection
    ├── Header (Title + Branding + Description)
    ├── Content Grid
    │   ├── Capabilities List (5 bullet points)
    │   └── Image Gallery (1 main + 2 side images)
    └── Benefits Section
```

### Image Assets:
Currently using placeholder images from your existing assets:
- `diary-image-1.jpg` - Main architectural image
- `diary-image-2.jpg` - Side image 1  
- `diary-image-3.jpg` - Side image 2

**Note**: You can replace these with actual architectural renderings by updating the import paths in `CapabilitiesSection.tsx`.

## 🚀 Current Status:

✅ **Ready to use** - The capabilities section is fully implemented and live
✅ **Responsive design** - Works on all devices  
✅ **Professional styling** - Matches your design requirements
✅ **Vietnamese content** - All text in Vietnamese as specified
✅ **Routed properly** - Accessible at your website's homepage

## 🔄 Future Enhancements:

### Easy Updates:
1. **Replace images**: Update the import paths in `CapabilitiesSection.tsx`
2. **Edit content**: Modify text directly in the component
3. **Adjust styling**: Update `profilePage.css` for design changes
4. **Add animations**: CSS transitions/animations can be added
5. **Connect to CMS**: Could be connected to backend for dynamic content

### Potential Additions:
- **Statistics counters** (animated numbers)
- **Client testimonials** integration
- **Project portfolio** preview
- **Contact form** integration
- **Service details** expansion

## 💡 Notes:

- The ProfilePage is set as your **default homepage** (`path="/"` in App.tsx)
- Uses your existing **color scheme** and **design language**
- **Mock data ready** - works with your `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` setup
- **SEO friendly** - proper heading structure and semantic HTML
- **Accessible** - proper contrast ratios and semantic markup

Your capabilities section is now live and ready to impress visitors! 🎉
