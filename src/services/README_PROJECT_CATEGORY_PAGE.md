# Project Category Page Service Integration

## Overview
The Project Category Page has been successfully integrated with the `projectCategoryPageService` to use dynamic data instead of static hardcoded data while preserving all mock data in the service.

## Files Created
1. **src/types/projectCategoryPageTypes.ts** - TypeScript interfaces for project category page data
2. **src/services/projectCategoryPageService.ts** - Service layer with comprehensive mock data and API structure
3. **src/services/README_PROJECT_CATEGORY_PAGE.md** - This documentation file

## Files Modified
1. **src/pages/ProjectCategoryPage.tsx** - Updated to use dynamic data from service

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Data Loading
- **Added state management** for `categoryData`, `pageData`, `isLoading`, and `error`
- **Integrated service** using multiple service functions
- **Added loading states** with LoadingSpinner component
- **Added comprehensive error handling** with retry functionality

### 2. Service Architecture
The service provides multiple access patterns with auto-switching between mock and API data.

### 3. Data Structure
Complete type definitions for CategoryData, SubCategory, and ProjectItem interfaces.

## Mock Data Preserved
All original static data has been preserved in the service with 4 main categories and 48 total projects.

## Benefits

- Enhanced development experience  
- Production ready API structure
- Better maintainability
